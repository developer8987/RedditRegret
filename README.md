# RedditRegret
Are you drunk? Tired of feeling black and white? Well, stop fumbling with those greased up chickens and delete ALL OF YOUR REDDIT COMMENTS. This cannot be undone. Follow instructions. That can be done. Hopefully.

# Dependencies
Python

JDK 8

Firefox

Geckodriver

VCforPython27

# Dependency installation insructons
Draw the rest of the fucking owl

# Instructions
After installing the dependencies, open terminal or cmd, navigate to the directory of the RedditRegret.py script, and type the following, replacing USERNAME with your username, and PASSWORD with your password. Your username and password will immediately be transferred to the CIA via carrier pigeon. To opt-out, please donate $5 to the charity of your choice:
  python RedditRegret.py USERNAME PASSWORD

# Troubleshooting
If you receive any errors, just google them, or contact me. The dependency instructions are not complete yet, so that's my bad.
